# Plotters 
## Plants-Project

Application designed to help users plan their garden.

Users can create account, provide information for their outdoor space, and populate simulated garden with plants of their choice.
They can also check the hardiness zone of their location and edit/delete their choice of plants.

The application is built with `reactjs` and FLUX, using `Bootstrap` and custom css in the front-end.
It uses `Flask` and `SQLAlchemy` for the back-end. 

It was a team project. Worked with [Pedro Cisternas](https://github.com/pedrocisternas)
